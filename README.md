# Initial Prompts for Exercise
1. Create a Furniture class, with some properties you think it would be helpful to have on such a class
2. Create Couch, Loveseat, Nightstand, DiningTable, and DiningChair classes that inherit from Furniture and implement their own properties
3. Create interfaces called ISeating and ITable to describe type of furniture that are either seating or tables
4. Have the appropriate classes you created in step 2 implement the interfaces you created in step 4
5. In your Main method, create a list of ISeating and add instances of each of the classes that implements that interface to the list
6. Do the same for ITable
7. Iterate through each list, and call a method or write out a property value that is specific to each interface (ie, for seating, you might have a Reupholster method, or for tables a ReplaceLegs method... but those are just examples)
8. Take all the instances of the classes from step two, and put them in a List of Furniture
9. Do the same thing with this List as you did in Step 7 for the other two lists
